# AI Model to recognize cardiac arrhythmia with convolutional nueronal network

## Overview
This repository contains the entire process for training (data processing and segmentation) a convolutional neural network (CNN) model designed to recognize cardiac arrhythmias using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database.

## Contents
- `model.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the CNN model's implementation and training.
- `ten_file_model.keras`: Keras model file.
- `mitbih_database`: Folder containing data files (not detailed).

## Getting Started
To use this model, clone the repository and ensure you have Jupyter Notebook and TensorFlow installed.

## Requirements
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy

## Usage
Open `model.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and run the cells to train the model or make predictions using the pre-trained model.

## Important Note
This project was taken from a public Kaggle database and was adapted with substantial changes by: Andres F. Vargas and Bryam Villalobos

## Contributing
Contributions to improve the model or extend its capabilities are welcome. Please submit a pull request or open an issue to discuss your ideas.
